# Atom TextBuffer Core [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atom/text-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atom/text-buffer) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/48xl8do1sm2thf5p/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/text-buffer/branch/master)


This is the core of the Atom text buffer, separated into its own module so its
tests can be run headless. It handles the storage and manipulation of text and
associated regions (markers).
